# Squareys' dotfiles

Hi! I am relatively new to vim (learning motions and basic commands in Vrapper since ~June 2016, more serious about it since October 2016). 
This is my vimrc and other "dotfiles".

## Installing

### Windows

Clone this repository into `%USERPROFILE%` and run `install.bat`. *This will overwrite any existing _vimrc in %USERPROFILE%!*

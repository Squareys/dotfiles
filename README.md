# Squareys' dotfiles

Hi! I am new to vim (learning motions and basic commands in Vrapper since June (?) 2016, more serious about it since October 2016). This is my vimrc.

## Installing

### Windows

Clone this repository into `%USERPROFILE%` and run `install.bat`. *This will overwrite any existing _vimrc in %USERPROFILE%!*
